<h1 align="center">All-Age Favourite Rivals</h1>
<h2 align="center">Messi vs Ronaldo</h2>

The most universal topic of debate in the contemporary football world is about who the better footballer is between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. Sport thrives on rivalries, and it is this one between the spearheads of Barcelona and Real Madrid that has defined the last decade in footballing circles.

When the inevitable question was once posed to Ronaldo himself, he had said, “You cannot compare a Ferrari with a Porsche because it's a different engine. You cannot compare them. He does the best things for Barcelona, I do the best things for Madrid.”

Whatever the man may say, we will make a comparison anyway. Messi exerts more influence on a match, playing more around the centre of the pitch than Ronaldo and bringing in more of his team-mates into attacks. Ronaldo is more comfortable taking solo runs on the wide sides, and he is much better as a finisher than the Argentine. Also, the Portuguese has at times been accused of being a ‘flat track bully’, effective in the lesser matches but disappearing when it really matters.
Ronaldo is more athletic of the two and is visibly more professional about taking care of himself. Messi’s balance is second to none, but because of his small size he can be knocked off the ball by more imposing opponents. He, however, seldom executes touches that are cute but ineffectual, something Ronaldo is guilty of sometimes.
But the above are all subjective comparisons. What do the numbers say?
We have attempted a detailed comparison of the statistics that the two players have gathered over their careers. Statistics of course never tell the whole story, but this is as objective a judgement as any that can be passed upon the million-dollar question.

Mumbai might get heavy snow, Russians could stop drinking vodka, Americans may stop funding its military and Volkswagen might even go bankrupt. Everything mentioned above is possible, but one thing in this world is never possible. Fans will never stop comparing Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. Perhaps this is because the current generation of football fans are experiencing perhaps two of the greatest gifts ever given to “the beautiful game”.
The Brazilian legend, Pele, has also stated that Lionel Messi is the “best in the world” over the past decade, which has encouraged further debate among fans.
In my opinion, Lionel Messi’s game shows precisely how much talent he has. It’s pure, perfect football. Ronaldo, on the other hand, is a fine example of how hard work can work wonders. He is perhaps one of the most hardworking players to ever grace the game.
